# ICLtbx
This package includes various tools for computing voxelwise, cross-regional entropy, temporal coherence, correlation coefficient, mutual information. Many of these metrics have been extended to handle between-session and between-subject data. BEN, TCM, and CTCM have been included in the other repositories. Detailed instructions for running the code can be found in readme.txt.
